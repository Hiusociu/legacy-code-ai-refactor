## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Security Vulnerabilities (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **No Authentication System**: Anyone can access and use the system
- [ ] **No Authorization**: No user roles or permissions
- [ ] **File Execution Risk**: Uploaded files could potentially be executed
- [ ] **XSS Vulnerabilities**: User inputs not fully sanitized
- [ ] **No HTTPS**: Running on HTTP in production would expose data
- [ ] **Session Management**: No secure session handling

### System Reliability (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Database Errors**: MongoDB connection failures cause crashes
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: No cleanup of uploaded files or analysis results
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: System doesn't recover gracefully from failures
- [ ] **Resource Exhaustion**: No protection against resource-intensive operations
- [ ] **Concurrent Request Handling**: May fail under load

### Testing & Quality Assurance (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **16 Failing Tests**: Critical components have failing tests
- [ ] **No Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows not tested
- [ ] **No Load Testing**: Performance under load unknown
- [ ] **No Security Testing**: Vulnerabilities not systematically tested
