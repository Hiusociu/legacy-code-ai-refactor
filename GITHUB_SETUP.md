# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 1. Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/storehubai

   - **Description**: `AI-powered legacy code analysis and refactoring system with real-time dashboard and guided modernization suggestions`
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if preferred)
   - **Initialize**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## 2. Push Code to Repository

After creating the repository, run these commands in the project directory:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace with actual URL from GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/storehubai/legacy-code-ai-refactor.git

# Push the code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
